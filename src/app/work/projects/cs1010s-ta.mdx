# CS1010S Programming Methodology – Teaching Assistant

## Overview

Served as a **Teaching Assistant** for CS1010S Programming Methodology at NUS School of Computing, supporting a foundational course that introduces problem-solving by computing and programming using Python to first-year students.
The role focused on guiding students through the transition from zero or minimal coding background to being able to design, implement, test, and debug programs independently using core programming constructs and fundamental problem-solving patterns.

## Teaching Responsibilities

### Weekly Tutorials and Hands-on Guidance

- Led a weekly tutorial group of approximately 15 students, facilitating live coding discussions, walkthroughs, and problem-solving sessions aligned with the CS1010S curriculum on topics such as control structures, recursion, higher-order functions, and data structures like lists and dictionaries.
- Guided students through hands-on exercises and tutorial questions, helping them build a clear mental model of program execution, including function calls, variable scope, and step-by-step reasoning about Python code behaviour.

### Assignment Support and Concept Reinforcement

- Provided targeted support on weekly missions and assignments, which form the core of CS1010S workload, by clarifying problem statements, decomposing tasks, and coaching students to apply appropriate problem-solving techniques rather than relying on solutions.
- Reinforced key course learning objectives such as computational thinking, algorithm design, testing strategies, and debugging practices to help students develop robust, readable, and logically structured programs.

## GitHub and Assessment Workflow

-Maintained the teaching team’s private GitHub repositories by reviewing and refining tutorial and assignment materials, ensuring conceptual accuracy, consistent coding style, and up-to-date references.

## Student Impact and Outcomes

### Strengthening Core Programming Foundations

- Enabled students to gain confidence in applying fundamental concepts such as problem decomposition, algorithm design, iteration, recursion, and basic data structures to solve progressively more complex programming problems throughout the semester.
- Helped students internalize a disciplined approach to programming: understanding the problem, designing solutions, writing code, testing thoroughly, and iterating based on failures and feedback.

### Collaborative and Supportive Learning Environment

- Fostered an inclusive and encouraging tutorial environment where students felt comfortable asking questions, discussing different solution strategies, and learning from mistakes.  
- Contributed to improved assignment quality and fewer recurring conceptual errors across the cohort by combining structured guidance, constructive feedback, and consistent GitHub-based review practices.
